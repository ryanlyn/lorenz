     *  idle debt goes unpaid — swept at the next `running` transition.

     *  what the turn settles with once its spawned subagents have settled —
     *  at the followup's terminal result (the summary has streamed by then),

     *  Accepted residuals. (1) A subagent that ends WITHOUT waking the model —
     *  its task_notification lost or skipped (only the terminal task_updated
     *  patch is guaranteed per transition) — leaves no followup result and no
     *  further idle, so the held turn parks until `session/cancel` or the next
     *  prompt (either settles it: the echo hand-off or ensureActiveTurn's
     *  held-turn hand-off). Settling at the prune sites instead would preempt
     *  the followup summary in the normal ordering (prunes precede the
     *  notification), and a grace timer was judged not worth the machinery —
     *  the same rescue contract as the adapter's other wedge classes (issue
     *  #825's out-of-scope notes). (2) Drained-ness is judged by live-task
     *  membership only: with parallel subagents, a notification that prunes
     *  the last task during an earlier task's still-streaming followup lets
     *  that followup's result settle the turn before the LAST task's summary
     *  streams — degrading to post-turn delivery for it, never worse than the
     *  pre-hold behavior (pending wakes are not countable: notifications can

     *  `turnAwaitingSubagents` (with `spawnedTaskIds`) to decide whether a

 *  so a later teardown-time abort of the (per-request) signal can't cancel a
 *  subsequent turn. `signal` also aborts on connection close, in which case
