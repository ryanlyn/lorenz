/**
 * `--hide-claude-auth`: this integration must never bill a claude.ai
 * subscription. The flag hides the claude.ai login method from `initialize`
 * and makes the agent behave like a logged-out CLI whenever a subscription
 * would pay for a turn. `acp-agent.ts` decides *when* the guard applies (flag
 * on, no provider override) and calls in here for the *what*.
 *
 * The account the CLI reports at `initialize` is the source of truth. The SDK
 * memoizes it, so it is a constant for the life of a query, and two layers
 * keep it honest:
 *
 * 1. Session creation refuses an account that holds no credential this
 *    integration accepts. A logged-out session never exists, so the client's
 *    sign-in always leads to a new session with a fresh `initialize`. The
 *    per-turn guard repeats the check on the same cached account, which costs
 *    microseconds and covers a session created under a provider override that
 *    `providers/disable` later removed.
 * 2. A sign-out during the session ends the query. The next turn recreates it,
 *    so the next `initialize` reports the real account and layer 1 judges it.
 *    The recreation resumes the stored conversation. When the CLI never wrote
 *    one, because the first turn was the one that signed out, the recreation
 *    starts a fresh query under the same session id instead.
 *
 * A file-based credential replaced by a subscription between two turns is seen
 * by the CLI probe the agent fires at the START of every user prompt. That read
 * is never awaited, so it usually lands mid-turn; all it does there is mark the
 * session. The guard consumes the mark at the turn boundary — the next prompt
 * recreates the query and layer 1 judges the account the new `initialize`
 * reports — so a probe never interrupts a running turn. A swap that happens
 * after the last probe stays unseen until the next prompt reads the store
 * again. Closing that window would cost a blocking read per turn.
