/**
 * `authStatus` — interim `_meta`-based ACP extension that reports which auth
 * identity the agent process itself uses (Claude subscription, API key,
 * gateway, external cloud credentials, or nothing).
 *
 * Push only. One carrier, connection-scoped (never per session): the
 * notification `_auth/status_update` → `{authStatus}`. The client never asks;
 * there is no request method. The empty `agentCapabilities._meta.authStatus`
 * marker means "this agent pushes its identity", nothing more.
 *
 * The agent reads the identity at these moments:
 * - `initialize`, with an asynchronous CLI probe. Nothing waits for it, and its
 *   result is the first push of the connection;
 * - a completed `authenticate` or a `logout`;
 * - each `createSession`, from the session account. A refused session reports
 *   too: the client must know which account was refused;
 * - each turn the `--hide-claude-auth` guard checks. The guard reads the
 *   account anyway, so this costs nothing;
 * - the START of each user prompt, with an asynchronous CLI probe. This finds a
 *   login or a logout done in another terminal, including the sign-in a client
 *   performs after a refusal, because the retried prompt is a new prompt.
 *   Nothing waits for it and the push goes out mid-turn if that is when the
 *   read lands.
 *
 * A probe whose kind differs from a live session's account marks that session
 * for recreation under `--hide-claude-auth`. The mark is a flag, consumed at
 * the next turn boundary: a running turn is never interrupted. The probe judges
 * nothing itself — the next turn runs a new `initialize`, and the creation
 * guard decides on the account it reports.
 *
 * A read does not always cause a push. The agent sends `_auth/status_update`
 * only when the payload is different from the last one it sent.
 *
 * "Cannot determine" is expressed by silence: an agent that cannot read its own
 * identity pushes nothing, and the client shows "not reported". A known
 * logged-out state is a payload of its own (`kind: "none"`), which is what
 * distinguishes the two.
 *
 * Reporting only — there is no write path in v1. When the upstream RFD lands,
 * the same payload moves from `_meta` to first-class fields and this module
 * is retired.
